 <li><h3>Younger days/School days:</h3></li>
<font size='4'><i>School is the place where <font color='crimson'>wonderful memories </font>are made & the<font color='crimson'> future of each child</font> is shaped.</i> ~Ankit Bachhawat<br />
 <p>
   I remember way back during school days. I used to hate waking up in the morning(which I still do😂) and dress up to go to school, recalling all the previous day's homework that was forced upon us all.And I remember I used to think to myself everyday,"Oh god! When will I grow up and there'll be no burden of studies all the freaking time".<br />
   But now I would just do anything to go back to my school days, sit in my classroom, play tic tac toe, bingo and many more with my friends.
